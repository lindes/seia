Social Equality Information Application

##Project Mission
Rough Draft:

Through online community, software development, knowledge curation, and information design, make relevant information about the inequalities in our socio-economic-political system, and the constructs that reinforce those inequalities, discoverable and irrefutable to support action toward increasing social equality.

##Description

Community software, including discussion boards and tools to share information outside of the community. The community software will facilitate people populating, structuring, exploring, visualizing, sharing, and utilizing information relevant to exposing and understanding social inequality, while working toward social equality.



##Aspects of Project

###Data Sources

Where does the data come from, how to maintain the feeds, how to ensure the integrity of the incoming data.


###Data Structure

How do we store and structure the data after consumption.


###Tools for Exploration and Analysis

UI to discover relevant information and to make the data useful


###Tools for Saving and Sharing

There needs to be a way to save a snapshot of the information, organized via the UI and sharable with others.  This snapshot would be explorable, and connect to the greater data sets that informed its creation.


###Community to Support Mission and Develop Project

The software should integrate community.  This includes those who help to populate the data, those who utlize the UI tools to discover information, and those who build the software.


##Development Approach
Start with small, simple components and iterate toward complexity.  Focus on clean interfaces and the glue between the various components.
