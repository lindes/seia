+ a mashup of deep data sets

Through the use of software and information design, make relevant information about the social inequalities in our socio-economic-political system, and the constructs that reinforce those inequalities, discoverable and irrefutable.

A community built around the development and analysis of information relevant to issues of socio-political-economic inequality.



Focus on simple solutions with explicit interfaces and high modularity.  Pay specific attention to the glue to between the various considerations.


1. Data Sources

Where to pull the data, how to maintain the feed, how to maximize the integrity of the data


2. Data Structure

How to store and structure the data.  Treat all units of analysis as verbs, by expecting them to change over time and storing the changes.


3. Tools for analysis

UI for exploring data and building meaningful analytical structures.


4. Methods of presentation

How discoveries are organized and captured.  Snapshots should provide the context and be presented in a way that is sharable and understandable by people who did not participate in it's construction.


5. Community to support mission and develop the infrastructure.
